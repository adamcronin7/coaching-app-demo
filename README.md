# coaching-app-demo
This mock coaching app was created to learn how to design a modern front-end web app with multiple pages in NextJS using the TailwindCSS framework for a coaching platform that can be expanded on in the future. This initial front-end design is based on an idea for an app where coaches would be able to provide lifting programs to their clients, and clients would be able to view and log their workouts, creating an easy and efficient platform for both coaches and lifters.

## Running locally
To run this locally, please ensure Node is installed

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the project's base directory:
```npm install```
This will install the correct modules used for this project.

The following command can then be used to start the server:
```npm run dev```

## Future Ideas
 1. Fill out the design details, such as creating a logo, extra descriptions, and an app name.
 2. Improve responsivness with an improved UI for mobile devices.
 3. Create a back-end to allow users to start logging real workouts with coaches.
