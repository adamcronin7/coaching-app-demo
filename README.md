# coaching-app-demo
This mock coaching app was created to learn how to design a modern front-end web app with multiple pages in NextJS using the TailwindCSS framework for a coaching platform that can be expanded on in the future.

## Running locally
To run this locally, please ensure Node is installed

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the project's base directory:
```npm install```
This will install the correct modules used for this project.

The following command can then be used to start the server:
```npm run dev```

## Future Ideas
 1. Fill out the design details, such as creating a logo, extra descriptions, and an app name.
 2. Improve responsivness with an improved UI for mobile devices.
 3. Create a back-end to allow users to start logging real workouts with coaches.
